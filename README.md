Repository to mess around with AI made using reinforcement learning

Tic Tac Toe:
  tictactoe.py implements the game. It has a class GameRunner than runs the game, and allows the viewing different aspects of the board to be used to decide next move
  trainer.py implements the training of the AI by reinforcement learning from random games
  game.py has four callbacks, two of which can we used at a time to play the game
