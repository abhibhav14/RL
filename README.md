This was me messing around with RL before I actually learnt RL, just based on the idea of rewards and maximizing them. The methods used here are not good RL methods


# Reinforcement-Learning
Repository to mess around with AI made using reinforcement learning

tictactoe.py implements the game. It has a class GameRunner than runs the game, and allows the viewing different aspects of the board to be used to decide next move

trainer.py implements the training of the AI by reinforcement learning from random games

game.py has four callbacks, two of which can we used at a time to play the game
